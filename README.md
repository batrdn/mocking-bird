# Mocking Bird

![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

Testing with real-world data scenarios is crucial, but creating such data shouldn't be a chore. _The Mocking Bird
Project_ aims to provide a simple and easy, yet accurate and context-aware data generation for your models or
schemas, so that it makes your testing experience smooth. Whether it be unit tests, integration tests or stress
tests, you can easily generate fake data with custom options and constraints.

What does it mean to be context-aware? It means that the generated data is not just random-random value, but it's
generated in a way that it's suitable for the fields and constraints of your model or schema. For example, if you have a field
`workEmail` in your model, the generated data will be a valid email address, and not just a random string.
